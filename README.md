# Predicting Customer Churn in Python
Churn analysis for a telecom company. Used python w/ pandas. scikit-learn

This is a re-work notebook after I took the "Predicting Customer Churn in Python" on DataCamp. While exploring the dataset, I added some of my own thought.

This notebook includes:
1. An exploratory Data Analysis
2. Prepreocessing
3. Train LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier model
4. Re-sampling to improve the recall score
